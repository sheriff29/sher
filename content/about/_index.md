#### Professional

From late 2011 till 2014, I managed procurement for two forestry organizations in the West African sub-region. I oversaw acquisition of timber - I specialize in species such as *sapele*, *mahogany*, *iroko*, and *ebony*. I also procured natural rubber - *Hevea Brasillensis* - specializing in vulcanized, scrap, and standard - cup lump - rubber types.

My job generally entailed mobilising local farmers and raw material producers into forming cooperative networks of suppliers; and appraising and negotiating prices for harvesting rubber latex on small and medium-scale rubber farms, and on plantation estates such as the [Firestone Rubber Plantaion](https://www.firestonenaturalrubber.com/#:~:text=Firestone%20Liberia%20Inc.%2C%20an%20indirect,clinics%20and%20a%20referral%20hospital.) in Harbel, Liberia, the [Societe Africaine de Plantation d'Heveas - SAPH](https://www.groupesifca.com/saph.php) in Dabou and San Pedro, Ivory coast, and the [Ghana Rubber Estate Limited - GREL](https://grelgh.com) in Takoradi, Ghana. To a limited extent, I also worked with logging firms in Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia to arrange the sale and export of timber logs - *mahogany* and *ebony* in Ghana and Ivory Coast, and *iroko* in Liberia - to overseas clients in China, Malaysia and the United States. Here, I was largely responsible for coordinating the logistics and export of purchased timber logs to overseas clients, creating business reports on general operation activities, and forecasting and predicting rubber demand and supply, as well as price dynamics in both local and international markets. From my daily responsibilities, I built strong negotiation and people skills. I was also refined my quantitative skills by building business intelligence models to forecast and analyze business trends. Furthermore, I developed a knack for working with Microsoft Excel, R, Power BI, and QGIS software to analyze and extract actionable inisghts from forestry and natural resource data

#### Education

In the past 2 years, I have explored solutions for improving conservation information sharing within high forest zone communities. Working under the able direction of [Dr. Terry Sunderland](https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/terry-sunderland/) at the [Sunderland Lab](https://sunderlandlab.forestry.ubc.ca/people/), I investigated the various ways local community leadership-based agencies can be exploited to drive conservation and sustainability information sharing for improved natural resource management outcomes. My research borrowed from theories and methods in psychology, information science, leadership and communication studies, and non-parametric statistics to examine questions on how local leaders participate in information sharing within local forest communities, and how they can be exploited to drive conservation management outcomes. Overall, my work contributed the following insights to existing literature:
* It highlighted the unique potential of leadership entities in local forest communities to help drive sustainability management outcomes.
* It positioned women leadership entities in forest communities as critical forces in conservation information sharing efforts given the increasing role of women in the natural resource sector.


#### Current Plans

Currently, I'm looking to join the BC professional forestry industry by obtaining a registered professional forester (RPF) accreditation, and using my research and analytical skills, extensive knowledge of forestry and natural resource procurement, good community relatiionship-building, and strong technical and scientific reporting to support organizational growth and success.
